Bury me six feet deep
Bury me six feet deep

Bury me sixfeet deepcover me in concrete turn me into a street
Bury me six feet deep, cover me in concrete turn me into a street
Chewy chewy, yummy yummy yummy
Sharp and pointy, yummy yummy yummy
Break me off a piece of that tasty treat
Sugar in my teeth, demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep for eternity
Bury me six feet deep cover me in concrete turn me into a street
Some people like candy
Some people like coffee
But these lifeless flavors don't satisfy me
I tried to eat ice cream
I tried to drink tea
But I need the taste of young blood in my teeth
Chewy chewy, yummy yummy yummy
Sharp and pointy, yummy yummy yummy
Break me off a piece of that tasty treat
Sugar in my teeth, demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep for eternity
Sugar in my teeth, demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep for eternity
